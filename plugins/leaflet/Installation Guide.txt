I. OVERVIEW

This Leaflet Maps plugin requires CKEditor 4.3 or later versions, and it leverages the power and flexibility
of Widget API. Hence, the 'widget' plugin is also a hard dependency (which also depends on Line Utilities
and Clipboard plugins). The Clipboard plugin is already loaded by default in all presets/pre-built packages of CKEditor
(Basic, Standard, and Full). Hence, we only need to download the Widget plugin (http://ckeditor.com/addon/widget),
the Line Utilities plugin (http://ckeditor.com/addon/lineutils), and this Leaflet Maps plugin (http://ckeditor.com/addon/leaflet).

For Linux users, after downloading, make sure that the zipped folders or the target CKEditor folders
    have right read/write/execute permissions, otherwise you might encounter loading issues
    like the "File x could not be found" notice. You might need to run "sudo chmod 777 -R leaflet",
    "sudo chmod 777 -R lineutils", and "sudo chmod 777 -R widget" before or after copying them
    in the appropriate CKEditor folders.


II. STANDARD INSTALLATION (Usual Setup)

1) After unzipping the folder, paste the three folders ("lineutils", "leaflet", and "widget")
    to "ckeditor/plugins" folder. After that, you should have the following folder structures:
        "ckeditor/plugins/leaflet"
        "ckeditor/plugins/lineutils"
        "ckeditor/plugins/widget"

2) Edit the "ckeditor/config.js" file, and add the following:
    if there's no existing line yet:
        config.extraPlugins = "lineutils,widget,leaflet";

    otherwise, append it to the existing list, no extra spaces are allowed:
        config.extraPlugins = "existing_plugin,another_existing_plugin,lineutils,widget,leaflet";

3.) Just to make sure, clear the web browser's cache after modifying your configuration.
    Clearing the browser's cache is also very important
    since the CKEditor's JS and CSS assets/components are cached also in the browser.


III. DRUPAL INSTALLATION

In Drupal, the typical way to embed the CKEditor WSYIWYG is
through the CKEditor module (https://drupal.org/project/ckeditor),
and then loading the corresponding CKEditor JS library (http://ckeditor.com/).

Drupal's CKEditor module (tested on version ) is typically installed to have this internal path:
    sites/all/modules/ckeditor or sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor.

Note that this guide is tested on CKEditor "7.x-1.13", latest version is "7.x-1.14".
I'll test this guide also in the latest version later.

Moreover, the CKeditor JS Library is typically installed to have this internal path:
    "sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor/ckeditor.js" or
    "sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor/ckeditor/ckeditor.js" or
    "sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/ckeditor.js."

However, installing additional plugins in CKEditor in Drupal is not that straightforward
as we could see from the issue queues:
    https://drupal.org/node/2215409#comment-8568207
    https://drupal.org/node/1930130#comment-7297628
    https://drupal.org/node/1324554
    https://drupal.org/node/2215497

Nevertheless, after experimenting with the various ways to enable the additional plugins
(Line Utilities, Widget, and Leaflet), this is the simplest solution
(the idea is to copy the plugin folders, enable them, and make them visible in the toolbar):


A. DRUPAL INSTALLATION OPTION 1

    1.) Download and unzip the plugins here (depending on your setup):
            "sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins" or
            "sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor/plugins".

        After that, you should have the following folder structures:
            "ckeditor/plugins/leaflet"
            "ckeditor/plugins/lineutils"
            "ckeditor/plugins/widget"

    2.) We should now activate the new plugins and add them to the toolbar.
        This is done by configuring the CKEditor Profile Settings,
        in which by default is located in:
            "admin/config/content/ckeditor/edit/Advanced"

        A. Activate the Plugins
            In EDITOR APPEARANCE >>> Plugins section:
            Enable the corresponding checkboxes for the Leaflet Maps, Line Utilities,
            and Widget plugins. These are the texts displayed adjacent to their checkboxes:
                "Plugin file: leaflet"
                "Plugin file: lineutils"
                "Plugin file: widget"

        B. Add them to the Toolbar
            We should then make the activated plugins visible in the toolbar,
            skipping this step will make the Leaflet Maps plugin inaccessible in the toolbar.

            In EDITOR APPEARANCE >>> Toolbar section:
            Drag the Leaflet Maps icon (black-colored) from the 'All Buttons' section
            to the 'Used Buttons' section.

            We need to configure the Leaflet Maps icon only since the Line Utilities and Widget plugins
            have no toolbar icons and they will just load in the background.

    3.) Then, click the Save button. Clear the Drupal's overall cache AND
        clear the browser's cache. Clearing the browser's cache is also
        very important since the CKEditor's JS and CSS assets/components
        are cached also in the browser.

    As indicated above, using the "sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins" or
    "sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor/plugins"
    will work with no additional custom hooks programming since by default
    CKEditor utilize that folder in the CKEditor Global Profile Settings:
    "admin/config/content/ckeditor/editg".

    If you go that Global Profile Settings page, this will be indicated
    (unless you override the default configuration):
        Path to the CKEditor plugins directory: "%m/plugins"

        In which "%m" refers to the base URL path where the CKEditor module is stored,
        and defaults to "sites/all/modules/ckeditor" or "sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor".


B. DRUPAL INSTALLATION OPTION 2

    With the advent of Libraries API (https://drupal.org/project/libraries),
    Drupal offers more flexibility in the handling of external/third-party libraries,
    which means a clean mechanism that provides a separation of control between
    the CKEditor module and CKEditor library, and implies that we could
    safely upgrade the library and module independent to each other.
    Having a Libraries folder (sites/all/libraries) is also a very common setup in Drupal.

    This setup assumes that you've already installed and enabled the Libraries API module
    and configured the CKEditor library (sites/all/libraries/ckeditor).
    Make sure also that the "Path to CKEditor" settings indicated in
    the CKEditor's Global Profile (admin/config/content/ckeditor/editg) is
    indicated as "%l/ckeditor", in which "%l" refers to the "sites/all/libraries".

    1.) Download and unzip the plugins here:
            "sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins"

        After that, you should have the following folder structures:
            "ckeditor/plugins/leaflet"
            "ckeditor/plugins/lineutils"
            "ckeditor/plugins/widget"

    2.) We should now activate the new plugins and add them to the toolbar.
        This is done by implementing first the hook_ckeditor_plugin() in a custom module:

        function MYMODULE_ckeditor_plugin() {
          return array(
            'leaflet' => array(
              'name' => 'Leaflet Maps',
              'desc' => t('Plugin for inserting Leaflet Maps.'),
              'path' => libraries_get_path('ckeditor') . '/plugins/leaflet/',
              'buttons' => array(
                'leaflet' => array(
                  'label' => 'Leaflet Maps',
                  'icon' => 'icons/leaflet.png',
                ),
              ),
            ),
          );
        }

        For convenience, I've created a Drupal utility module specifically for this purpose,
        check-out the module and instructions here:
        https://github.com/ranelpadon/drupal-leaflet-maps/tree/master

        Fortunately, we need only to register the Leaflet Maps plugin,
        the Line Utilities and Widget plugins are automatically registered.
        The Leaflet Maps Drupal module above is enough for our purpose.

        Now, we configure the CKEditor Profile Settings,
        in which by default is located in:
            "admin/config/content/ckeditor/edit/Advanced"

        A. Activate the Plugin
            In EDITOR APPEARANCE >>> Plugins section:
            Enable the corresponding checkbox for the Leaflet Maps plugin.
            This is the description displayed adjacent to its checkbox:
                "Plugin for inserting Leaflet Maps."

        B. Add them to the Toolbar
            We should then make the activated plugin visible in the toolbar,
            skipping this step will make the Leaflet Maps plugin inaccessible in the toolbar.

            In EDITOR APPEARANCE >>> Toolbar section:
            Drag the Leaflet Maps icon (black-colored) from the 'All Buttons' section
            to the 'Used Buttons' section.

            We need to configure the Leaflet Maps icon only since
            the Line Utilities and Widget plugins have no toolbar icons and
            they will just load in the background.

    3.) Then, click the Save button. Clear the Drupal's overall cache AND
        clear the browser's cache. Clearing the browser's cache is also
        very important since the CKEditor's JS and CSS assets/components
        are cached also in the browser.

Note that if you configure the Leaflet Maps, Line Utilities, and Widget plugins
using the handy CKEditor auto-builder (http://ckeditor.com/builder) and
bundled it with the core "ckeditor.js" file, it will not work in Drupal,
since as far as I know, the Drupal's CKEditor module
(or specifically the hook_ckeditor_plugin()) has no support for it yet.

But, outside of Drupal, the Leaflet Maps will work even when
pre-configured/auto-bundled using the CKEditor builder.
